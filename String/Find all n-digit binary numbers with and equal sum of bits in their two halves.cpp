/*

Given a positive number n between 1 and 9, find all nâ€“digit binary numbers with an equal sum of left and right half. The binary number should not start with 0 and for odd numbers, the middle element can be 0 or 1.

Input: n = 6
Output: {100001, 100010, 101011, 110011, 100100, 101101, 101110, 110101, 110110, 111111}

Input: n = 7
Output: {1000001, 1001001, 1000010, 1001010, 1010011, 1011011, 1100011, 1101011, 1000100, 1001100, 1010101, 1011101, 1010110, 1011110, 1100101, 1101101, 1100110, 1101110, 1110111, 1111111}
